# Pre-work - *Tipping-O*

**Tipping-O** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Hongyuan Jiang**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Custom font
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added a horizontal picker view to choose tip percentage
- [x] Make the background color change to bring delightfulness to the app
- [x] Made 15% as the default tip percentage so the user could see the tip and total amount once they put the number in.

## Notes

I spent a lot of time on the horizontal picker view, including how to get the picker view work in the main storyboard,as well as customizing the style of picker view, and how to make the background gradient color change when the % is changing. It's my first time working with Xcode, so I spent a lot of time looking for information online. But it's a lot of fun!
